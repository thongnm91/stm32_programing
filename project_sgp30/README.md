# Embedded System on STM32L152RE

## Introduction

This project follows the Udemy course [**Embedded Systems Bare-Metal Programming Ground Upâ„¢ (STM32)**](https://www.udemy.com/course/embedded-systems-bare-metal-programming/).  
I chose the **STM32L152RE** to practice because this board has similar functionality to the STM32F4 used in the course, but it is specifically designed for **low-power** applications.
